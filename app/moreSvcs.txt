Player Bar (ckpoint 8)

"change the private attribute currentSong into a public attribute named 
 SongPlayer.currentSong so that we can use it within the player bar"
--public? Private? similar to global/local? Unclear how to tell which is 
 which in SongPlayer.js controller since everything is legit inside one 
 function.
