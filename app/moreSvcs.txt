Player Bar (ckpoint 8)

"change the private attribute currentSong into a public attribute named 
 SongPlayer.currentSong so that we can use it within the player bar"
--public? Private? similar to global/local? Unclear how to tell which is 
 which in SongPlayer.js controller since everything is legit inside one 
 function.


--don't get syntax of {{this stuff}} in player_bar.html

--wtf private/public functions/attributes?? Finding stuff about Python and 
 TypeScript, neither of which are relevant.
**anything created w/var inside SongPlayer fn is private(not accessible to
 outside modules/functions)...anything attached to whatever you're returning
 (in this case, SongPlayer obj) is public. SongPlayer.next, .prev, .pause
 are all public. SetSong and playSong are private; only called within other
 fns. Attributes = anything attached to object; property.


CP 9:
Declaring an empty scope property ensures that a new scope will exist 
 solely for the directive (referred to as isolate-scope). An isolate-scope 
 allows us to bind functions from the directive's view to its scope. ????
