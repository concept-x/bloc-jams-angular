8/29 questions

1. why isn't there a default template (global file) showing in the localhost:3000
 view? Why can't I get back to the landing page when I click the logo in 
 the nav bar? 

2. why do I have both landing and index pages? Check file structure (see
 ckpoint 2 or 3).

Collection

.state('collection', {
          url: '/collection',
          templateUrl: '/templates/collection.html'
