Angular Vocab
 module
 service: does the actual work of fulfilling user request
 inject: insert into parens @ beginning of function like JS parameter
  *Also to insert in angular module as item in array of dependencies
	way of passing in dependencies as arguments
 dependency: something required for getting work done
 constructor: function that creates object...not best practice
 controller: listens to user requests; sends instructions to service
 method: line 36 & 40 in fixtures.js. Method = function that lives on object
  as property/value
 $scope (why is it there so many times?)
